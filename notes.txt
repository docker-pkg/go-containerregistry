- TaggableToManifest in v1.remote needs to be shared between local and remote implementation. is there a better way to design this?
- remote.Artifact proposed by John has some shortcomings. i don't know what to do with non-image types. See: pkg/v1/remote/puller.go:147
- What to do with `Catalogger` and `Catalog` methods. Seems duped.



Other questions;

New feature for crane append where `--append` symlinks blobs instead of copying them when output is an oci-layout instead of registry. 
This is really useful for rules_oci where symlinks can be used if the layer comes from another build task. 
Alternatively this could be a new command that takes an uncompressed or compressed layer and prints the diff-id and digest for the layer 
so we can symlink the blobs before we invoke crane. (cache hit)
